# CardTrackerBETA
This is the beta site for Josh's shiny card tracker

Hello! thanks for looking :) This is basically my virtual binder so i can easily access and track my pokemon collection (because I'm an Adult Nerd)

Feel free to use this code for your own or leave a comment in case you have any feed back!
I am just starting to learn Html and CSS, hopefully in the future i'll know how to use javascript to make this site even more cool B)
